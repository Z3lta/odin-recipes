    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sandwiches are an excellent source of stable, non-arousing, dietary stimulation for your sustenance. Ingesting a sandwich will often cause a feeling of moderate satisfaction.</p> 
    <p>In fact, I'm actually typing this while eating a sandwich with one hand, further illustrating the absolute utility of this any-time meal. Today, we'll be discussing the assembly of the average American mainstay; the BLT. This bundle of joy contains three core ingredients that are beautifully abbreviated into its common monikerl; bacon, lettuce, tomato. By pairing these delectable components with a supple pair of whole wheat bread slices, I believe that we can be taken back to a time of simplicity. </p>
    <p>As they say, variety is the spice of life. When the time comes, we will expand the scope of our undertaking to involve the challenge that has plagued culinary artisans all throughout the ages. The challenge that is represented by the question "what goes well with BLT". If your rambunctious ass answered "mayo and mustard" then respectfully, vacate the premises.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of whole wheat bread</li>
        <li>bacon</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your bread slices, either by toasting them first or without. At this step, you may glance over at a mayonaise jar, and if you do, call yourself a clown. We will be enjoying the delight of an unadulterated BLT today.</li>
        <li>Place the lettuce on at least one slice of bread. You may choose to adorn both slices of bread with their own lettuce pieces, in the event that you'd like more fiber today.</li>
        <li>Place your bacon on top of the lettuce, such that the bacon is vertically oriented in the center, left, and right side of the bread slice. Remember to orient vertically with respect to the longest side of the bacon strip. If I see your bacon hanging out of a sandwich in public, I'm walking up and biting the piece that is hanging out of it.</li>
        <li>On the other slice of bread, adorn it with a tomato round. Not a slice, a round. A slice is but a thin whisp--an echo of the long forgotten harmonic balance between acidic and sweet. Ensure that you slice your tomato such that the resulting piece is a round that is a fingernail's length in thickness.</li>
        <li>Now, hoist the slice of bread adorned with your tomato round into the air. You should use a grip that allows you to pinch the top of the tomato round (and maybe your potential lettuce) against the slice of bread without piercing it.</li>
        <li>Once hoisted, proceed to firmly match it on top of the slice adorned with lettuce and bacon. Be sure not to smoosh your creation, as the tomato juice could seep into your bread, thus destroying its structural integrity.</li>
        <li>Now, step back and admire your sandwich. Appreciate this moment you've created, built upon the shoulders of creatives, artisans, pioneers, and adventurers who paved the way.</li>
        <li>Understanding your place in all of this, approach the sandwich without pity. Use both hands to grasp the sandwich so that the ingredients within are aligned horizontally on a level plane. If I see your sandwich corners drooping in public, I'm walking up to you and slapping it towards the ground.</li>
        <li>Invite the unadulterated culinary delight onto your senses by moving the sandwich in this manner into your oral orifice.</li>
    </ol>
